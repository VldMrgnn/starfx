## `parallel`

This is `Promise.all` on steroids and doesn't cancel all other tasks when one
fails.

It can wait for all tasks to complete, receive them in the order in which they
were created, or receive them in the order in which they were completed. They
are safe, meaning one task won't crash another one -- or the parent task.
