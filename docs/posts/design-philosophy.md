title: Design Philosophy
---

- user interaction is a side-effect of using a web app
- side-effect management is the central processing unit to manage user
  interaction, app features, and state
- leverage structured concurrency to manage side-effects
- leverage supervisor tasks to provide powerful design patterns
- side-effect and state management decoupled from the view
- user has full control over state management (opt-in to automatic data
  synchronization)
- state is just a side-effect (of user interaction and app features)
