Why do we call this a micro-mvc framework? Well, our controllers are lighter
weight than traditional MVC frameworks.

Controllers do not relate to pages, they most often relate to centralized pieces
of business logic. This could be as simple as making a single API endpoint and
caching the results or as complex as making multiple dependent API calls and
combinatory logic.
