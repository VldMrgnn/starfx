description: How to activate controllers

We use the term `dispatch` when we are emitting an event with a specific type
signature
([flux standard action](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action)).

There are two ways to activate a thunk: by dispatching an action or calling it
within another thunk.

The type signature of `dispatch`:

```ts
type Dispatch = (a: Action | Action[]) => any;
```

Within `starfx`, the `dispatch` function lives on the store.

```ts
const { createSchema, createStore } from "starfx";
const [schema, initialState] = createSchema();
const store = createStore({ initialState });

store.dispatch({ type: "action", payload: {} });
```

You can also use dispatch with a `react` hook:

```tsx
import { useDispatch } from "starfx/react";

function App() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "click" })}>Click me!</button>;
}
```

# Listening to actions

This is a pubsub system after all. How can we listen to action events?

```ts
import { take } from "starfx";

function* watch() {
  while (true) {
    const action = yield* take("click");
    // -or- const action = yield* take("*");
    // -or- const action = yield* take((act) => act.type === "click");
    // -or- const action = yield* take(["click", "me"]);
    console.log(action.payload);
  }
}

store.run(watch);
```

`watch` is what we call a [supervisor](/supervisors). Click that link to learn
